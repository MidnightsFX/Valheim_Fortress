## What is Valheim Fortress
When the Valheim Devs released the blog ["Fearsome Foes!"](https://www.valheimgame.com/news/development-blog-fearsome-foes) they talked about a concept called "Fortress Time!".
They did not go into details about what this idea was, but I was very excited! However, what that ended up being, while exciting was not what I was expecting.

I wanted a system that would encourage building a massive fortress, defending it, and reaping rewards for doing so!

So now you know half of what this mod means to be. The other half is primarily cosmetic, and ease of use. 
That being, more colorways for buildable pieces along with new variants with the goal of helping ensure large-scale base defense does not become too tedius.
